# StringToAsciiLetters
What this program will entail is the ability for the user to enter a string 
of up to 100 characters and have an edited string printed back to them.
The program will take the string and place it in an allocated area
in memory. The string will then go through a loop to test whether the
char at index of string meets alphabetic arguments. If character meets arguments 
the char will print. If it does not, or string is terminated, the print char will be
passed over. 

This program is strictly for understanding of structure of MIPS programming. It allows 
the programmer to view how to work with addresses and the values of those addresses, as
well as structure of overall program along with appropriate comments of program.
